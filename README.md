# SentimentAnalysis
 
I designed and implemented a C program to dynamically allocate memory and parse the VADER lexicon file, allowing for the extraction of sentiment scores and intensity values for individual words. By integrating this word-level sentiment data into a custom sentiment analysis algorithm, I was able to compute sentiment scores for entire sentences. This project combined natural language processing techniques with practical applications in analyzing text sentiment, such as monitoring social media trends and evaluating customer feedback.
